<p>
<h2> 1 – 2 boneless ribeye or scotch fillet</h2>
</p>
<p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
<li>Salt and pepper</li>
<li>5 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
<li>6 sprigs fresh thyme or 3 sprigs rosemary</li>
<li>5 garlic cloves</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
</p>
<p>
Bring to room temp: Take the steak out of the fridge 30 minutes prior to bring to room temperature.
Dry steaks: Pat dry with paper towels.
</p>
<p>
Heat skillet: Heat oil in a heavy based skillet over high heat until it is very hot – you should see smoke!
Season: Sprinkle each side of the steak generously with salt and pepper, then immediately place in the skillet.
Sear Side 1: Cook for 2 – 2.5 minutes until you get a great crust, then turn.</p>
<p>
Garlic Butter: Leave for 1 minute, then push steaks to one side and toss in butter, garlic and thyme. BE CAREFUL – the thyme will sputter!
Baste: As soon as the butter is melted, continuously spoon the butter over the steak until it’s cooked to your liking – 2 minutes in total for the 2nd side for medium rare (52C/125F, chart below for other doneness temps)</p>
<p>
Basting also renders fat on the side of the steak – use tongs to sear the edges at the end if you want it browned more.</p>
<p>
Rest: Transfer steak to a plate and cover loosely with foil, rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Serve steak with a bit of the butter from the skillet drizzled on top. Pictured in post with Crispy Smashed Potatoes.
